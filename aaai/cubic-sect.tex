  We illustrate the content and methods of our theory by using it in this
  section to derive a non-conservative entropic force that affects SGD.
  We sketch a path toward Corollary \ref{cor:entropic} while avoiding the
  generality and notation of the next section.%\S\ref{sect:calculus}.\squash

\subsection{Notation and assumptions, I}\label{sect:setup}
    %--  the landscape  -----------------------------------------------

  We formalize the loss --- suffered by a fixed architecture on a random
datapoint --- as a distribution $\Dd$ over functions from a space $\Mm$ of
weights.  The \emph{testing loss} $l:\Mm\to\RR$ is $\Dd$'s mean.  We write
$\theta\in\Mm$, $l_x\sim\Dd$ for generic elements.
%
We consider training sequences $(l_n: 0\leq n<N) \sim \Dd^N$.  We call
$n$ and $l_n$ \emph{training points}.
%
Each initialization $\theta_0 \in \Mm$ then induces via SGD a
distribution over trajectories $(\theta_t: 0\leq t \leq T)$.  Specifically,
SGD runs $T$ steps of $\eta$-steepest descent:
  \begin{equation*}
    \textstyle
    \theta_{t+1}^\mu
    \coloneqq
    \theta_t^\mu -
    \sum_{\nu}
    \eta^{\mu\nu} \nabla_\nu l_{n_t}(\theta_t)
  \end{equation*}
where each sequence $(n_t: kN\leq t<kN+N)$ is a permutation of $(n:
0\leq n<N)$.  Here, Greek indices name components of
$\theta,\eta,\nabla$ with respect to a fixed basis.  We view $\eta$
as a bilinear form, not for generality but to constrain the type-correct
operations to those of geometric significance.
%

Throughout this paper we assume:
%
\textbf{Derivative Bounds}:
there compact sets $(K_k: k\geq 0)$ so that
$\nabla^n l_x(\theta)\in K_k$ for all $\theta,l_x$. 
Here $\nabla^k
l_x(\theta)$ is a $k$th derivative, a tensor with $k$ axes.
%
\textbf{Analytic Moments}:
any polynomial $p$ of the $l_x$ and its higher derivatives
induces a random variable so that
$\expct{p}:\Mm\to\RR$ (exists and) is analytic in $\theta$;
moreover, $\expct{p}$'s radii of convergence are strictly bounded from $0$,
even as $\theta$ varies.
%
Consequently, $\nabla \expct{p}=\expct{\nabla p}$.

We quote a well-known result
(\cite{ne04}, \S 2.1), proved by induction on $T$, to illustrate our notation:
\begin{prop}\label{prop:nest}
    $G = \nabla l(\theta_0)$ controls the loss to leading order.
    Precisely,
    $
        \expc[l(\theta_T)-l(\theta_0)]^\mu =
        - 
        T \sum_{\mu\nu} G_\mu \eta^{\mu\nu} G_\nu
        + o(\eta^1)
    $.
\end{prop}
For noiseless linear landscapes (when $\nabla l_x(\theta)$
depends on neither $x$ nor $\theta$), this estimate is exact.
%
This paper identifies how noise and curvature correct Prop
\ref{prop:nest} by developing 
%large-$T$
techniques less
opaque and more convergent than induction.
%

\subsubsection{Diagrams in brief}\label{sect:diagrams-in-brief}

That development begins with the observation that each $\eta$
`connects' two $\nabla$ operators as indices prescribe.  So we
draw
$\eta$s as edges, $\nabla^k l$s as nodes, and each
summand of the following form (evaluated at $\theta=\theta_0$)
$$
    \sum_{\text{all Greek indices}} \wrap{\prod_{j\in J} \eta^{\mu_j\nu_j}}
    \wrap{\prod_{i\in I} \wrap{\prod_{k\in K_i} \nabla_{\xi_{i,k}}}
    l_{x_i}} \wrap{\prod_{k\in K_\star} \nabla_{\xi_{\star,k}}}
    l
$$
as an undirected graph with edges indexed by $j\in J$, nodes
indexed by $i\in I\sqcup \{\star\}$, and an edge $j$ incident
to a node $i$ when $\{\xi_{i,k}:k\in K_i\}$ meets
$\{\mu_j,\nu_j\}$.  Per \textsc{factoring}, we also equip these
graphs with a partition of nodes to account for correlation
structure.
%
Such diagrams offer the same advantages over direct notation that %of compactness and of clarity as
decimal numerals offer over unary numerals.  More importantly,
their topology has dynamical significance and leads to a
physical interpretation of SGD.

\subsection{An entropic force with curl}\label{sect:entropic-curl}
The displacement $M_1=\expc[\theta_T - \theta_0]$ contains many
order-$\eta^3$ summands, including those of the form\squash
$$
    \textstyle
    \Delta^\xi_{xyz} \propto 
    -
    \sum_{\substack{\mu\nu    \\ \omicron\pi\rho}}
        \eta^{\mu\omicron} \, \eta^{\nu\pi} \, \eta^{\xi\rho}
        \,
    \expct{
        (\nabla_\mu l_x)
        \,
        (\nabla_\nu l_y)
        \,
        (\nabla_\omicron\nabla_\pi\nabla_\rho l_z)
    }
    \squash
$$
where $0\leq x,y,z<N$ label datapoints.
Let $\Delta_\circ = \expc[\Delta_{xxz}-\Delta_{xyz}]$ for $x,y,z$
distinct.\squash\  $l_x, l_y, l_z$ are i.i.d., so:
$ 
    \Delta_\circ^\xi \propto 
    -
    \sum_{\cdots}
    \eta^{\mu\omicron} \, \eta^{\nu\pi} \, \eta^{\xi\rho}
    C_{\mu\nu} J_{\omicron\pi\rho}
$
or, schematically, 
    $\boxed{\Delta_\circ^\xi
    \propto -\eta^3 C\nabla H}$.\squish\ 
Here, $C_{\mu\nu} = \expc_x[\nabla_{\mu} l_x \nabla_{\nu} l_x] - G_\mu G_\nu$ is the covariance of gradients,
$H_{\pi\rho} = \nabla_\pi\nabla_\rho l$ is $l$'s hessian, and
$J_{\omicron\pi\rho} = \nabla_\omicron H_{\pi\rho}$
is $l$'s `jerk'.\footnote{

The expression $-\eta^3 C\nabla H$ suggests that SGD moves
toward flat minima (see  Figure \ref{fig:cubic}).
%
The bilinear form
$F^{\mu\nu}=\textstyle\sum_{\xi\omicron}\eta^{\mu\xi}
\eta^{\nu\omicron} C_{\xi\omicron}$ determines which $H$s
are `large' or `small'.  E.g.: if $F$
degenerates along a covector $v$, then $H$'s 
$v$-component does not affect $\Delta_\circ$.
%\footnote{
%    Explicitly: if
%        $\sum_{\mu\nu} v_\mu F^{\mu\nu} v_\nu = 0$,
%    then replacing $H$ by $\tilde H_{\mu\nu} = H_{\mu\nu} + 42 v_\mu v_\nu$

Diagram techniques establish
this `entropic force'\footnote{
    Thermal systems tend toward disorder as if pushed by an
    `entropic force'.

    bands: their polymers can wreathe in
    many ways but be straight in only one.
    Such `forces' characteristically

    Our result ($T\gg 1$) is $\Theta(\eta^2)$; \cite{ya19b}'s
    ($T=2$) is $\Theta(\eta^3)$.  We

    effect.

as dominant when $G=0$, $N=T$.
Evaluating a single diagram

%
\begin{cor}\label{cor:entropic}%[Computed from $\sdia{c(01-2-3)(02-12-23)}$]
    Start SGD at a minimum of $l$ with $H>0$, $N=T$ and use
    an eigenbasis of $K=\eta H$.  
    For any $T$ and
    with ${\mathcal P}_T(s) = (1 - \exp(-Ts))/s$,
    the final displacement
        $M_1^\xi$
    is
    $$
        -
        {\textstyle\sum_{\substack{\mu\nu    \\ \omicron\pi\rho}}}
            C_{\mu\omicron}

            \eta^{\mu\nu}\eta^{\omicron\pi}
            J_{\nu\pi\xi}
            {\color{gray}{\mathcal P}_T(K_{\xi\xi})}\eta^{\xi\rho}/2
        + o(\eta^3)
        \squish\squish
    $$
\end{cor}

Consider a 1D valley of near-minima wherein $\eta H$ has spectrum
$\lambda_0 \ll 1/T \ll \lambda_1 \leq \cdots$ for eigenvectors
$v_i$.  Let's ignore diffusion along the valley: $(\eta C) v_0 =
0$.
%
Then ${\mathcal P}_T(\lambda_0)\approx T$ and every
$C_{ij}{\mathcal P}_T(\lambda_i+\lambda_j)$ is $O(T^0)$.  So $M_1$
scales linearly with $T$.  We thus expect SGD to move with
velocity $-f(\eta,H,T)\cdot C\nabla H/2$ toward flat minima.  
Observe that $\nabla ({\frak G}_C \star l) = \nabla l+C\nabla
H/2 + o(C)$, where ${\frak G}_C \star$ denotes convolution with a
\emph{fixed} centered $C$-shaped Gaussian; we conclude with the
intuition that \emph{SGD descends on a $C$-smoothed landscape that
changes as $C$ does}.  Since the smoothed $l$ may itself evolve,
SGD might eternally circulate.

To test Corollary \ref{cor:entropic}'s $C$-dependence,
\S\ref{appendix:artificial} constructs a landscape, \Helix, on
whose valley of global minima $C$ varies (Figure
\ref{fig:archimedes}).  As in Rock-Paper-Scissors, each point
$\theta$ has a neighbor that is more attractive (flatter) with
respect to $C(\theta)$.  This induces eternal motion into the page
despite the landscape's discrete translation symmetry in that
direction.  Corollary \ref{cor:entropic} predicts a velocity of
$+\eta^2/6$ per timestep, while \cite{ch18}'s SDE-based analysis
predicts a constant velocity of $0$.\footnote{
    Indeed, \Helix' velocity is $\eta$-perpendicular to the image
    of $(\eta C)^\mu_\nu$ in tangent space.
}
One may add a small linear term to \Helix\ to make SGD eternally
ascend; one may wrap \Helix\ in a loop to make SGD circulate,
witnessing a velocity field with curl (\S\ref{appendix:artificial});
this is
possible because $C\nabla H$, unlike $\nabla(CH)$, is not a total
derivative. 
In avoiding \cite{we19b}'s constant-$C$ assumption, we 
find that SGD's velocity field can have curl.
