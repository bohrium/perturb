        We quantify how gradient noise shapes the dynamics of stochastic
        gradient descent (SGD) by Taylor-expanding with respect to the learning
        rate.  We present a new diagram-based technique that permits
        re-summation of that series to convergent results on short timescales
        or near local minima.  We physically interpret the resulting terms as
        entropic corrections to deterministic descent.  Our theory predicts that
        gradient noise biases SGD's trajectory toward low-curvature, low-noise
        regions of the loss landscape.  We contrast our theory against popular
        approximations of SGD such as SDE
        and experimentally verify our theory's predictions.

        %%approximations: deterministic descent and stochastic differential
        %%equations.  We find that SGD's trajectory avoids regions of weight
        %%space with high gradient noise and avoids minima that are sharp with
