While we were able to address the Reviewers' specific technical questions in
our Author Feedback, we found it difficult to demonstrate our thorough but
subjective improvements to writing clarity and accessibility.

Thus, in keeping with the guideline to include no "links to external material"
for the Non-Meta Reviewers, we offer to the Meta-Reviewer an anonymized link
where they may spot-check our revised paper body to verify our claims of
improved writing quality.  Specifically, our revised pdf may be found here: 

    https://github.com/moomitten/anon-drafts/revised.pdf

The github account and its single repository have no identifying public
metadata.  Note: as stated in the Author Feedback, we have revised the main
paper body but not yet our appendices.
